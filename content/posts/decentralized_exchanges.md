A Decentralized Exchange, or DEX for short, is, like the name suggests, a place where you can trade Crypto Currencies.  
But you can do that on centralised exchanges, like Binance or Coinbase. **So why do we need DEXs then?**
<!--more-->

### Why we need DEXs
The problem with centralised exchanges is, that you don't actually own the Cryptocurrency in your account.  
There is a saying: "*Not your keys, not your crypto*". Meaning, when you don't hold the crypto currency in your own wallet, with your own private keys, you don't technically own them. The Exchange just owes you a certain amount of crypto. And that would be fine, if everybody in the world would be playing fair. But not everybody plays fair. There have been incidences of shady crypto exchanges suddenly closing down and then running with all crypto, that customers transferred there. Or Exchanges being targeted by hackers, that stole large amounts.  

### But how could DEXs solve these issues?  
You don't have to send your funds to a DEX in order to complete a trade, it happens directly from wallet, to wallet, you will just have to cover the transaction cost. On some DEXs you can just submit a trade and wait for someone to trade with you for that amount and price. But as you can imagine, that is not quite ideal, since you need to find a perfect match for the trade you want to make.  
So what is often being done these days, is that DEXs use liquidity pools. This is, simply put, where users can submit tokens of a specific trading pair to a smart contract. If there is now a trade, the funds will be drawn from this pool, that got filled by users. As compensation for providing liquidity, those liquidity providers will receive part of the trading fee.  
To balance a liquidity pool, if too many one sided trades happen, the rewards will be adjusted so, that it becomes more profitable to submit more liquidity to the lower one.  

And because DEXs run on the Blockchain, no one can take them down. They still need a Website as a frontend to interact with them conveniently. But since they are, generally, open source, everybody could host them themselves, if need be.  
In the future even the Website frontends could be hosted decentralised. 

### Popular DEXs
