# The Idea

The idea is to power applications with Ethereum which can be used by everybody but can't be taken down due to its decentralized structure.
It's the world's programmable blockchain.
Ethereum builds on Bitcoin's innovation, with some big differences.
Both let you use digital money without payment providers or banks. But Ethereum is programmable, so you can also use it for lots of different digital assets.
This also means Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you.


# The Creation

The Whitepaper for the creation of Ethereum was published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. 
Then in 2014 a Yellowpaper with the technical specifications was released and the coin went the first time on sale but could only be purchased with [Bitcoins](/science-communication-btc/posts/bitcoin).
Since the start the price for the for the coin was all in all constantly rising.


# Future 

At the moment the target is to shift from the [Proof of Work](/science-communication-btc/posts/proof_of_work) concept to the less power hungry [Proof of Stake](/science-communication-btc/posts/proof_of_stake) conception.
In the future there will be a major update to the Ether-Coin called Eth2. The goals of the update are:
- Better scalbality: If Ether gets used to buy everything for the daily use it needs to support 1000s of transactions per second for a fast and cheap usage.
- The security must be reinforced against all kinds of attacks.
- The sustainability has to increase: With the algorithms used today to much energy and computing power is needed so there has to be done something.
