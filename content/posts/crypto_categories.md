An Explanation about the different Categories of Crypto Currency. 
<!--more-->

-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Store of Value
The most prominent example of a cryptocurrency, [Bitcoin]({{< ref "posts/bitcoin.md" >}}) ₿, falls heavily under the *Store of Value* Category. While Bitcoin is the only Cryptocurrency solely in this category, other coins can have Store of Value characteristics as well.  
Store of Value means, that, due to the deflationary nature of this coin, it is a good choice to invest into it and hold it over long periods of time. This is to protect your funds from inflation and maybe even have potential gains in value. Just like people have done, so far, with gold or stocks.

As for Bitcoin, due to its maximum supply, that is capped to ₿21,000,000 and the way that the mining rewards decrease over time, the supply in circulation will approach 21 Million. But because many Bitcoin have been lost and still get lost forever (Either because of lost wallets, or because they are sent to invalid addresses), Bitcoin is technically deflationary.  
Since its creation, the demand for Bitcoin has steadily risen and so far there is no sign of this trend reversing. And how basic economics tells us, if you have increasing demand and a fixed, or even decreasing supply, as is the case with Bitcoin, the price is bound to rise. 

# Smart Contract
Smart Contract Crypto Currencies allow someone to create programs, that are stored on the Blockchain and will be executed once a certain condition is met. Those distributed programs, or *Smart Contracts* cannot be modified, or tampered with, any more. This is, because everybody who is participating actively on the network, has to store an entire copy of the blockchain.  
Multiple of those Smart Contracts can form a decentralized Application or *dApp*. There are already numerous dApps, but in the future they could replace current centralized services.  
Those Smart Contracts can also be used to create new kinds of Cryptocurrency tokens, also the infamous NFTs or Non-fungible Tokens. Those are Tokens, of which only one can exist. Those could be used to create digital representations of art pieces, or anything, really.  
Compared to Store of Values Coins, those often have an infinite supply cap, to ensure, that there will be always enough coins, to interact with theese dApps.  

The most widely known and second largest Cryptocurrency overall, is [Ethereum]({{< ref "posts/ethereum.md" >}}). 
Other big Smart Contract Cryptos are [Cardano]({{< ref "posts/cardano.md" >}}), Polkadot, Chainlink, Stellar, or VeChain. 

# Payment
Payment Cryptocurrencies were created to replace our current payment system and to address some problems of other Cryptos, that prevent those from being widely used for regular payments. While Bitcoin originally was created as an alternative for our financial system, these days it has too expensive transaction costs and too slow transaction times.  
Examples of payment cryptos are: Luna, Bitcoin Cash, Dash

## Stablecoins

To address the problem of price volatility, but keep the advantages of Cryptocurrency, sometimes those systems come with so called *Stable Coins*. Those have a fixed value, compared to their respective Fiat counterpart, like EUR or USD.  
This can generally work via two ways.  

### Asset Backed
The issuer of the Stablecoin must have the equivalent amount of Fiat currency in a bank account, so that one Stablecoin corresponds to f.e. 1€. So basically a "*I owe you*" for 1€, that can be redeemed later. But those types of Stablecoins can be backed by anything, really. Like Precious Metals, Diamonds, Oil or even other Cryptos. The disadvantage to those is, that they are centralized, because they must be issued by someone. 
Examples for those types of stablecoin are: 
- Tether: USDT 
- Coinbase: USDC
- Crypto backed: Dai

### Algorithmic
Algorithmic stablecoins don't need to be backed by anything. How they hold their value (There are different ways, but I will use the Terra Luna system as an example):  
The stablecoin can be swapped for their token they are based on (like LUNA for Terra, or ETH on Ethereum). And the rate at which can be swapped is determined by an Algorithm, that changes, based on supply and demand and the actual value of the Fiat currency. So if too many one sided swaps happen, it will get slightly more attractive to swap the token to the stablecoin, giving it a larger supply, fixing the price.  
Algorithmic stablecoins are for example:
- Terra: Includes stablecoins for many currencies: UST (USD), EUT (EUR), KRT (Korean Won), JPT (Japanese Yen) and many more. 
- Ampleforth (Built on Ethereum)


# Privacy
Even though Bitcoin has the reputation of being anonymous, it really isn't. It only is pseudo anonymous, because all transactions, that ever happened, can be perfectly tracked on the Blockchain. So if your real identity would ever get linked to a certain Bitcoin address, all your past and future transactions could be traced.  
That problem is addressed by Privacy Cryptocurrency, that grant their users absolute anonymity.  
The prime example of one of those is Monero. Because it features unbreakable encryption, store of value characteristics like Bitcoin, extremely low cost and fast transactions and greater decentralization, than most most other Cryptocurrencies, due to its unique Random X mining algorithm.  
Other Privacy coins are: Zcash, Dash, Grin, Beam
