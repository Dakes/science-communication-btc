### The Problem
Payments on the Internet, so far always relied on centralized financial institutions. Those transactions, completed by those centralized institutions, are under complete control by them. Meaning, you have to fully trust this third party. That is called the "*Trust based model*".  
<!--more-->
The problem with that is, that those transactions are reversible. In the case of a dispute, for example, your Bank or PayPal, could revert your transaction, if they agree with the other party.  
Or even worse, if you live under a totalitarian government, that you oppose, they could force your financial institution to freeze your bank account, or give out details about your past transactions.  
Those Problems could be avoided using physical currency, but up until Crypto Currencies, there existed no way to make a transactions over the internet without a trusted party. (*Trustless*)

### The Solution
The solution proposed first, in the Bitcoin Whitepaper, is an electronic peer-to-peer system, based on cryptographic proof, instead of trust.  
Peer-to-peer means, that you don't connect to a centralized party, but to other participants on the network.  
Transactions are confirmed by so-called "miners" who write those transactions into a "block" together with a hash (Cryptographic summarization) of the previous block. Hence the name "Blockchain".  
This allows any two willing parties to fulfill a transaction, directly from person A to person B, without a trusted third party.  
How this works in detail, will be explained in other Articles: [Bitcoin]({{< ref "posts/bitcoin.md" >}})
