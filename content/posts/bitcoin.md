Bitcoin known as the first crypto currency.

# The Creation

Bitcoin was founded in 2008 as the first cryptocurrency.  
With the background of the subprime financial crisis in which the Lehman brothers crashed the trust in banks and other finacial institutions was destroyed. So a decentralized digital currency would be a great solution for the payment.  
Also the financial system only relies on the trust in itself and can make up prices for transactions as they want.  
The founder has worked under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto up to this day it is not known if it was a single programmer or a group of programmers who made up the bitcoin.  


# The Idea

The idea behind the foundation of Bitcoin was to establish a way to make payments directly from peer-to-peer without the need of an finacial organisation. In this case a digital signature provides safety against frauds.  
The concept [Proof of Work](/science-communication-btc/posts/proof_of_work) ensures that the blockchain comes from the biggest pool of computing power so you would need to produce fake blocks more than 50% of the total amount of computing power.  


# Enviromental Issues

There are big enviromental problems caused by the complex tasks that have to be solved to expand the blockchain.  
The highly specialized ASIC-Miners can't work efficent forever caused of the increasing complexicity of the mining so there is lots of electronis waste every time a new generation of miners is released.  
Bitcoin's current estimated annual power consumption is 119 TWh which nearly equals to the electricity consumption of the netherlands.  
These problems could be solved with a change of the [Consensus Mechanism](/science-communication-btc/posts/consensus_mechanisms).
