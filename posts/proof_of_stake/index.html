It&rsquo;s used for many newer crypto currencies and some established ones are even shifting from the <a href=/science-communication-btc/posts/proof_of_work>Proof of Work</a> concept to Proof of Stake.</p><hr><h1 id=what-is-proof-of-stake-pos>What is Proof of Stake (POS)?</h1><p>Proof of stake is a type of consensus mechanism used by blockchain networks to achieve distributed consensus.<br>It requires users to stake their coins to become a validator in the network. Validators are responsible for the same thing as miners in Proof of Work: ordering transactions and creating new blocks so that all nodes can agree on the state of the network.<br>Proof-of-stake comes with a number of improvements to the Proof of Work system:</p><ul><li>better energy efficiency – you don&rsquo;t need to use lots of energy mining blocks</li><li>lower barriers to entr due to reduced hardware requirements – you don&rsquo;t need elite hardware to stand a chance of creating new blocks</li><li>stronger immunity to centralization – Proof of Stake should lead to more nodes in the network</li></ul><h1 id=proof-of-stake-staking-and-validators>Proof of Stake, Staking and Validators</h1><p>Proof of Stake is the underlying mechanism that activates validators upon receipt of enough stake.<br>For example for Ethereum, users will need to stake 32 ETH to become a validator.<br>Validators are chosen at random to create blocks and are responsible for checking and confirming blocks they don&rsquo;t create.<br>A user&rsquo;s stake is also used as a way to incentivise good validator behavior.<br>For example, a user can lose a portion of their stake for things like going offline (failing to validate) or their entire stake for deliberate collusion.</p><h1 id=how-validation-works>How validation works</h1><p>When you submit a transaction on a shard, a validator will be responsible for adding your transaction to a shard block. Validators are algorithmically chosen by the blockchain to propose new blocks.</p><h1 id=attestation>Attestation</h1><p>If a validator isn&rsquo;t chosen to propose a new shard block, they&rsquo;ll have to attest to another validator&rsquo;s proposal and confirm that everything looks as it should.<br>It&rsquo;s the attestation that is recorded in the blockchain rather than the transaction itself.<br>At least a specified number of validators are required to attest to each shard block – this is known as a &ldquo;committee.&rdquo;<br>The committee has a time-frame in which to propose and validate a shard block.<br>This is known as a &ldquo;slot.&rdquo;<br>Only one valid block is created per slot, and there are 32 slots in an &ldquo;epoch.&rdquo;<br>After each epoch, the committee is disbanded and reformed with different, random participants. This helps keep shards safe from committees of bad actors.</p><h1 id=crosslinks>Crosslinks</h1><p>Once a new shard block proposal has enough attestations, a &ldquo;crosslink&rdquo; is created which confirms the inclusion of the block and your transaction in the beacon chain.<br>Once there&rsquo;s a crosslink, the validator who proposed the block gets their reward.</p><h1 id=finality>Finality</h1><p>In distributed networks, a transaction has &ldquo;finality&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s part of a block that can&rsquo;t change.<br>To do this in proof-of-stake a finality protocol, gets validators to agree on the state of a block at certain checkpoints. So long as 2/3 of the validators agree, the block is finalised. Validators will lose their entire stake if they try and revert this later on via a 51% attack.<br>This is like a miner participating in a 51% attack, causing their mining hardware to immediately burn down.</p><h1 id=proof-of-stake-and-security>Proof of Stake and Security</h1><p>The threat of a 51% attack still exists in Proof of Stake, but it&rsquo;s even more risky for the attackers. To do so, you&rsquo;d need to control 51% of the staked coin. Not only is this a lot of money, but it would probably cause the coins value to drop. There&rsquo;s very little incentive to destroy the value of a currency you have a majority stake in. There are stronger incentives to keep the network secure and healthy.<br>Stake slashings, ejections, and other penalties exist to prevent other acts of bad behavior. Validators will also be responsible for flagging these incidents.</p><h1 id=pros-and-cons>Pros and Cons</h1><ul><li>Staking makes it easier for you to run a node. It doesn&rsquo;t require huge investments in hardware or energy, and if you don&rsquo;t have enough coins to stake, you can join staking pools.</li><li>Staking is more decentralized. It allows for increased participation, and more nodes doesn&rsquo;t mean increased % returns, like with mining.</li><li>Staking allows for secure sharding. Shard chains allow Ethereum to create multiple blocks at the same time, increasing transaction throughput. Sharding the network in a Proof of Work system would simply lower the power needed to compromise a portion of the network.</li></ul><ul><li>Proof of Stake is still in its infancy, and less battle-tested, compared to Proof of Work</li></ul><h1 id=sources>Sources</h1><p><a href=https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#top>Ethereum: Proof of Stake</a><br><a href=https://ethos.dev/beacon-chain/>Ethereum: Further Infromation on the Proof of Stake blockchain</a><br><a href=https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-proof-of-stake/>Proof of Stake in general</a><br><a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp>Proof of Stake in general</a><br><a href=https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/proof-of-stake-explained>Proof of Stake in general</a><br><a href=https://blokt.com/guides/proof-of-stake>Cover Image</a></p></article></section></div></div><footer class="ui basic center aligned segment" style=background-color:transparent><p>© 2021 Science Communication: BTC</p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ target=_blank>Hugo</a> with theme <a href=https://github.com/g1eny0ung/hugo-theme-dream target=_blank>Dream</a>.</p></footer></div></section><section class=back><div class=dream-max-width><header class="ui basic very padded segment dream-header"><div class=content><h1 class="ui medium header">Science Communication: BTC<span class="sub header"></span></h1><article class="ui horizontal list"><a class=item href=/science-communication-btc/posts><i class="archive icon" title=Archives></i></a>
